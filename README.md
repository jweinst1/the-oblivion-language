The Oblivion Language
=======

Oblivion is a modern programming language that takes an unorthodox approach to syntax and computing. The language seeks to extend the use of operators, and diminish the need for excessive syntax. Oblivion uses many different basic concepts, with the ideology that smaller, simple pieces of code can be more easily abstracted into larger, more sophisticated programs.

Oblivion is structured around the concept of specificity. For example, instead of having the `+` operator be used for addition and concatenation, the `&` operator facilitates concatenation, while the `+` is used exclusively for addition.
