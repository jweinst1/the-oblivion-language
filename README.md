The Oblivion Language
=======

Most common and widely popular programming languages run off an imperative paradigm. You write code in those languages to change the state of the program you want to create. The code is compiled into either byte code, for languages like `Java`, or an executable file, if your writing in languages such as `C++`. The compiled code runs on machines, either virtual ones or physical one's inside your computer. The instructions from the compiled code are executed 

Oblivion is a programming language constructed around a paradigm of automata-based programming. The language utilizes the concepts and theory of machines for computation.
