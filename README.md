The Oblivion Language
=======

Most common and widely popular programming languages run off an imperative paradigm. You write code in those languages to change the state of the program you want to create.

Oblivion is a programming language constructed around a paradigm of automata-based programming. The language utilizes the concepts and theory of machines for computation.
