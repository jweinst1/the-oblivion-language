The Oblivion Language
=======

Most common and widely popular programming languages run off an imperative paradigm. You write code in those languages to change the state of the program you want to create. The code is compiled into either byte code, for languages like `Java`, or an executable file, if your writing in languages such as `C++`. The compiled code runs on machines, either virtual ones or physical one's inside your computer. The instructions from the compiled code are executed by the machine, producing some desired result or functionality.

The Java Virtual Machine, also called the `JVM` is a stack based virtual machine. It accepts byte code as input instructions, which correspond to changes in the machine. When the 

Oblivion is a programming language constructed around a paradigm of automaton-based programming. The language utilizes the concepts and theory of machines for computation.
