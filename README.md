The Oblivion Language
=======

Oblivion is a modern programming language that takes an unorthodox approach to syntax and computing. The language seeks to extend the use of operators, and diminish the need for excessive syntax. Oblivion uses many different basic concepts, with the ideology that smaller, simple pieces of code can be more easily abstracted into larger, more sophisticated programs.

Oblivion is structured around the concept of specificity. For example, instead of having the `+` operator be used for addition and concatenation, the `&` operator facilitates concatenation, while the `+` is used exclusively for addition.

In Oblivion, the proper expression to match a simple assignment is `{x} -> (6) -> @`. Here, we perform the assignment via a stream of units. The `{x}` expression is called a name unit, which is similar to the concept of a parameter in other languages. The `->` expression is the apply connector. This takes the previous unit and applies it to the next unit. The `@` symbol represents the bindings unit. It is similar to a local and global bindings scheme in languages like Python.
