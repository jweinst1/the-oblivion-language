# Chapter One: Units

Units are the most basic component of any code written in Oblivion. They are small, simple elements that each have a single purpose and function. The concept behind this is that, the composition of units in a Oblivion program is highly flexible in it's style and layout. One goal can be achieved in many different ways.

The concept of units is to allow for the manipulation of low level abstraction and accessibility, in a readable, straight forward way.
