# Chapter One: Units

Units are the most basic component of any code written in Oblivion. They are small, simple elements that each have a single purpose and function. The concept behind this is that, the composition of units in a Oblivion program is highly flexible in it's style and layout. One goal can be achieved in many different ways.

## Value Units

The first fundamental type of unit in Oblivion is the value unit, also called a `V-Unit`. A V-Unit represents a reference, or pointer to a specific value, or object.
