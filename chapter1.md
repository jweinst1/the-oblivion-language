# Chapter One: Units

Units are the most basic component of any code written in Oblivion. They are small, simple elements that each have a single purpose and function. The concept behind this is that, the composition of units in a Oblivion program is highly flexible in it's style and layout. One goal can be achieved in many different ways.

## Value Units

The first fundamental type of unit in Oblivion is the value unit, also called a `V-Unit`. A V-Unit represents a reference, or pointer to a specific value, or in some cases an object. A V-Unit, in the simplest sense, cannot do anything in and of itself. This type of unit can only have other units applied to it, or have itself applied to other units.

#### Integer Unit

An Integer Unit, also called a `I-Unit`, contains a single integer value:

```
(5)
(7)
(999)
(-88)
```
#### String Units

A String Unit, also called an `S-Unit`, contains a series of string characters. These units work differently than other languages. There is no empty string, all strings must have at least one character in them.
