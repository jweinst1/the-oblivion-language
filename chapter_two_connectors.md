# Chapter Two: Connectors

In Oblivion, every unit is related to another unit by a connector. Connectors employ the task of mapping one unit to another, and compounding the successive mapping of several units into more units. They are perhaps the most abstract feature in all Oblivion, since they allow very low level processing and flexibility. The concept of connectors is to completely undo the standard features of a programming language, such as for loops, functions, classes, exceptions, as well as instances, and give way for a genuine new experience. Here is a formal definition of a connector:

> A Connector is a symbolic element that represents a relationship between two or more units. It is responsible for embodying meaning between units, and how they will carry out a process.

Every series of Units and Connectors only concerns a single, linear process. This means that, units are linked together in one stream. You can only access another binding or unit if you start use the `|` terminator. The placing of Oblivion statements is very flexible, so you can make a single program into a single line, or many lines if you wish.
