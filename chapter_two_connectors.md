# Chapter Two: Connectors

In Oblivion, every unit is related to another unit by a connector. Connectors employ the task of mapping one unit to another, and compounding the successive mapping of several units into more units. They are perhaps the most abstract feature in all Oblivion, since they allow very low level processing and flexibility. The concept of connectors is to completely undo the standard features of a programming language, such as for loops, functions, classes, exceptions, as well as instances, and give way for a genuine new experience.

Every series of Units and Connectors only concerns a single, linear process. This allows the focus to be on tiny parts of each program, and build many operations together as you build them up.
