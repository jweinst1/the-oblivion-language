# Non-deterministic Finite Automaton


The defining, most significant rule that must be followed by a *deterministic* finite automaton is that for every instruction or input, there is always on and only one corresponding transition. Whenever this rule is broken, a machine become *Non-deterministic*, meaning that an instruction is no longer entirely deterministic of it's next state.
