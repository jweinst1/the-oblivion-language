# Container Units

Container Units are units which hold one or more values, very similar to the concept of a data structure. Some container units possess indexes, some do not. These types of units are useful for manipulating multiple values in the same process, as value units can only hold a single value at a time. They all share the square brackets, `[]`, with a few variations on special containers.
