# Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Automaton

In order to understand `Oblivion` as a language, one must first learn the foundations of machines, automaton, and their respective properties. Before the theory behind automaton is explained, the concept of a state, and how states compose a machine. After that, the structure of an abstract automaton will be depicted, followed by the construction of machines. Lastly, the classical types of automaton will be discussed, such as push down automaton, finite state machines, and Turing machines.

This chapter provides a tutorial to the processes and behavior of abstract machines. However, the variety of automaton defined in mathematical terms is rather small in number. The Oblivion language implements and constructs many, many more types of machines, and gives a far greater array of customization available to you.
