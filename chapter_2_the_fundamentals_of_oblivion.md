# Chapter 2: The Fundamentals of Oblivion

Oblivion is a language constructed from features, structures, and tools that are entirely different than most any other programming language. The Oblivion programming language does not use functions or functional-based programming constructs. The language also does not use classes, or object-oriented programming features at all. Learning the fundamental principles of the language helps tremendously before tackling Oblivion's syntax.
