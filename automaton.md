# Automaton

When someone thinks about machines, they often think about factories, robots, engines, and gears. Factories, are composed of specific machines that automate various tasks. Each machine, is often operated via changing it's mode of function, or mode of operation. When a car goes from park, to drive, to reverse, the car is changing its *states* of motion.

Now, how does the car change it's state of motion? It receives input from the driver, through a lever, or a stick shift. Every change in the positioning of a stick shift changes the *input* being received by the car.

####The Light Switch

The simplest machine, in abstract terms, is a light switch. A light switch, one that can be turned on and off. When the switch is pointing up, the light is on. When the switch is pointing down, the light is off.
