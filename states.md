# States

A state, in the logical sense, is a singular, identifiable instance of some object or element. An instance, refers to the possession of one or more values, of which two different states will not have the same values. The most common states programming languages feature are `true` and `false`. Typically, a logical expression, such as `5 == 4`, will evaluate to `false`, because it's not valid. 

Both `true` and `false` are different states. `null`, another common state in conventional programming languages, represents the absence of a value. However, it is equally just as much as a state as `true` and `false`. In an abstract sense, we can have many more states than just the Boolean set of `true` and `false`. `A`, `B`, and `C` can, in theory also be thought of as states. We could even think of every word as a state itself. Now, is a number, a state?
